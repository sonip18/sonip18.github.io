        <p>“Every person is unique in his own way” as said by the famous poet Milton. God sends everyone in this world with some potential and some noble purpose to serve. Now, the question is, whether or not we are aware of this special potential that we possess.</p>
        <p>I am Sonip Bhattarai, hailing from BuddhaShanti, Jhapa. I am presently pursuing Bachelors degree in computer applications from Mechi multiple campus, Bhadrapur. Moreover, I am proficient as well as a capable and confident person. I have learned to be very hard-working as well as passionate about my career from the very core. Since my childhood, I have always been trained to focus on my passion.</p>
        <p>It is my father who taught me to be courageous in difficulties and keep myself motivated. My father is a farmer and My mother is a housewife. It is truly said, that ambiance judges your capability. Seeing my father being very punctual and dedicated to his profession and my mother to be always caring to the people I have always tried to keep myself be a very helpful and humble person.
            My mother who is a housewife always motivates me and drives me to work better and better each day. She has transformed me by giving me a vision for my future. It was only because of her efforts that I am here, in the college of my dreams.
            </p>
            <p>Also, as we talk about family, the immediate next people we think about in our lives, are our friends. The contribution of friends can never be ignored. I always have the back of my few friends who are with me, through the thick and thin. Even in my school days, I was always motivated by my friends to discover myself. So, I can say that I am pretty satisfied with my surroundings and I’m really grateful to God for giving me a supportive ambiance altogether in my life. I have a brother. He is excellent in studies and he is, too, the source of inspiration in my life. At every point in my life, I always receive their motivation. They encourage me even if I fail at any point.</p>
            <p>My school has always given me holistic development and helped in building my personality and skills. It made me what I am today. Your future is decided, by what you do today and it is the power of the present that helps you show your future. So, without action, a dream will always be a dream. It’s your action that makes your dream work.
                It’s not necessary to only complain about what life has not given you, rather than it is to find out what life has actually in store for you. God has given everyone the potential and it is in our hands how we use it. We weave our present to see a beautiful design in the future.
                </p>
                <p>As a role model, I always look upon Virat Kohli as my inspiration and I always dream to be like him who is enthusiast, energetic and passionate towards his passion. I am driven by his enthusiasm, energy, and vitality with which he has won various battles of his life. Therefore, it is in our hands, how we master ourselves to look into a beautiful future and I truly believe in this. Best of luck to all of my friends</p>
